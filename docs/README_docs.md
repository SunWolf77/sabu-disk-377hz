# 🔎 Appendix — Tech Notes in Plain Language  

We’re using three main tools to explore the **Sabu Disk** and **Buga Sphere** anomalies:  

---

## 1. FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)  
- Think of FFT as a way to **split sound into colors**.  
- Just like a prism splits white light into a rainbow, FFT splits vibrations into their frequency components.  
- **Why it matters here:** when we sweep sound through the objects, we see specific peaks (233, 377, 610 Hz) that stand out — like hidden “notes” the object naturally wants to sing at.  

---

## 2. PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry)  
- Fancy term, simple idea: it’s a way to **see how air or fluid moves**.  
- Imagine putting smoke in the air and shining a laser to watch how it swirls.  
- **Why it matters:** the Sabu Disk and Buga Sphere show **spiral vortex lattices** in simulation — suggesting intentional design for resonance and flow.  

---

## 3. STL Files (3D Models)  
- STL is just the **file format for 3D printing** — like a blueprint.  
- Repo includes **placeholder STLs** (rough shapes for Disk and Sphere). These let anyone print test versions or run simulations.  
- Once full schematics are available, accurate STLs can replace these placeholders.  

---

## 🌞🐺 Why This Matters  
- **Sabu Disk (Planar):** flat harmonic lattice, strong resonance at **377 Hz**.  
- **Buga Sphere (Volumetric):** spherical lattice, Fibonacci pivots at **233, 377, 610 Hz**.  
- **Together:** planar + spherical harmonics hint at a **complete lattice system** — resonance tech hidden in plain sight.

## Next Steps  
- Share visuals (FFT + PIV plots).  
- Invite collaboration on refined STL models.  
- Compare simulations with physical resonance tests (acoustic + EM sweeps).
