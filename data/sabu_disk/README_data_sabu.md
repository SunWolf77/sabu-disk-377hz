# ðŸ“Š Data Folder â€” Sabu Disk 377 Hz

This folder contains simulation data for the **Sabu Disk** (~3000 BC, Egypt, schist, tri-lobed artifact).  
Focus: resonance tests around **377 Hz** (Fibonacci #14).

## Files

- **raw_fft_data.csv**  
  Frequencies (50â€“1000 Hz) and amplitudes from simulated FFT sweep.  
  Used to check resonance peaks â€” especially at ~377 Hz.

## How to Use

1. Run the quick resonance check:
   ```bash
   python code/fft_quickcheck.py
